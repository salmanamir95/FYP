/**
@page open_source_guide Contributing to DataExSys

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to DataExSys! We are building a secure, resilient, and open framework for decentralized communication, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## Project Vision

Our goal is to create a practical, software-based solution for secure data exchange in ad-hoc networks. We believe in the power of decentralized, trust-based systems and are committed to developing this project in the open. The long-term vision extends beyond this application into a full, security-hardened kernel-space networking stack.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports and documentation improvements to new features and security research.

### Reporting Bugs

- If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
- Describe the bug in detail, including the steps to reproduce it, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior.
- Include information about your environment (OS, compiler version, etc.).

### Suggesting Enhancements

- If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to start a discussion.
- We are particularly interested in ideas related to performance optimization, new attack mitigations, and improving the consensus model.

### Submitting Code

1.  Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
2.  Write clean, well-commented code that adheres to the existing style.
3.  Add unit tests for any new functionality.
4.  Ensure all existing tests pass.
5.  Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch.
6.  In your PR description, clearly explain the changes you have made and why. Link to any relevant issues.

## Areas Where We Need Help

- **Testing**: Expanding our test suite, especially for attack and defense scenarios.
- **Performance Profiling**: Identifying and optimizing bottlenecks in the cryptographic and networking code.
- **Documentation**: Improving our API documentation, tutorials, and guides.
- **Portability**: Testing and ensuring the code builds and runs correctly on different platforms (e.g., different Linux distributions, macOS, Windows/WSL).
- **Front-end Development**: As we move into FYP-II, we will be building a Qt-based GUI. Expertise in Qt/QML is highly valuable.

We look forward to your contributions!
