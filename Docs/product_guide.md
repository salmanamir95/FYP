## Secure, Autonomous Networking for the Edge

**DataExSys** is a software-defined networking solution that provides a secure, resilient, and fully decentralized communication fabric for devices operating in infrastructure-less environments.

### The Problem

In modern IoT, industrial, and tactical deployments, devices often need to communicate directly in ad-hoc networks where no central server or trusted authority is available. These networks are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can disrupt communication, compromise data, and disable critical operations. Existing routing protocols were not designed with security as a first principle.

### The Solution: The DataExSys Secure Fabric

DataExSys transforms any group of Linux-based devices into a self-organizing, self-healing, and security-hardened network. Our patented multi-layer blockchain architecture and Bayesian trust model provide unparalleled protection against network attacks.

**Key Product Features:**

*   **Zero-Trust Onboarding**: New devices are securely onboarded using a decentralized PKI and a hybrid consensus mechanism that prevents unauthorized access and Sybil attacks.
*   **Intelligent Trust-Based Routing**: Our system continuously evaluates the behavior of every node, creating a dynamic trust score. Routes are automatically optimized to use the most reliable paths, isolating and neutralizing malicious nodes in real-time.
*   **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every critical network event—from node registration to packet transmission—is logged on a tamper-proof distributed ledger, providing complete visibility and forensic capability.
*   **Attack-Resistant by Design**: Purpose-built to defeat common threats like Blackhole, Wormhole, and Replay attacks right out of the box.
*   **Lightweight and Deployable**: Optimized for resource-constrained environments and delivered as a pure software solution, requiring no specialized hardware.

### Target Markets

*   **Industrial IoT (IIoT)**: Secure communication between sensors, actuators, and controllers in a factory or remote site.
*   **Emergency Services & Disaster Response**: Create instant, reliable communication networks for first responders when traditional infrastructure is down.
*   **Tactical Military Networks (MANETs)**: Enable secure, peer-to-peer communication for soldiers and unmanned systems on the battlefield.
*   **Autonomous Vehicle Networks (VANETs)**: Provide a secure foundation for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.

### FYP-II: The DataExSys Application

The next phase of development will produce a deployable Linux application with a Qt-based graphical front-end. This application will provide:
*   A user-friendly interface for secure messaging and data exchange.
*   A real-time network visualizer for monitoring network health, trust scores, and security events.
*   Simple configuration for deploying nodes in either "honest" or simulated "attacker" roles for training and demonstration purposes.
